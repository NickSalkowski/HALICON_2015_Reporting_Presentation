## There are so many options ...

The right approach to producing reports depends on:

- Your Data
- Your Audience
- Your Analysis
- Your Report Universe

Of course, there might not be one approach that works a lot better than the others.

## Your Data

- How big is your data set?
- How often is your data updated?
- How important are up-to-date reports?

## Your Audience

- Does your audience need a static report or an interactive report?
- Does your audience need a specific report format?

## Your Analysis

- Does your analysis need an unusually powerful computer?
- Does your analysis take a long time?

## Your Report Universe

- Do you know which reports will be needed?
- How many different reports might be needed?

## Three Basic Report Frameworks

- **Direct**

    R writes the final report itself 

- **Markup**

    R writes the report in a markup language
    
    The markup language file is processed into the final report format

- **Interactive**
    
    R does the analysis behind a user interface

## Direct Reports

- Direct reports can usually be generated quickly, which is important if you need to produce a large number of reports, or the reports will quickly become obsolete.
- Report formatting can be challenging!

## Markup Reports

- The markup language makes it much easier to format reports
- The process of generating the final report may be slow

## Interactive Reports

- Only generate the reports needed by your audience
- Reports are as current as the data used

## Example Data Set

```{r}
iris_split <- split(
  x = iris[-5], 
  f = iris$Species)
class(iris_split)
names(iris_split)
head(iris_split$setosa, 3)
```

## Direct Text Report Function

```{r}
iris_text <- function(ll, out_dir) {
  out_file <- file.path(out_dir, paste0(names(ll), 
                               ".txt"))
  write(
    x = c(paste("Species:", names(ll), "\n"),
          paste("Mean Sepal Length:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Sepal.Length"]])),
          paste("Mean Sepal Width:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Sepal.Width"]])),
          paste("Mean Petal Length:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Petal.Length"]])),
          paste("Mean Petal Width:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Petal.Width"]]), "\n"),
          "Page 1 of 1"),
    file = out_file,
    append = FALSE)
  invisible(NULL)
}
```

## Generating the Reports

```{r}
system.time({
  for (i in seq_along(iris_split)) {
    iris_text(iris_split[i], "direct_txt")
    }
  })
list.files("direct_txt")
```

## Example Report 

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(paste(readLines(file.path("direct_txt", "setosa.txt")), collapse = "\n"))
```

## Why?

That report wasn't very impressive, but

- It illustrated the basic structure: write a loop where each iteration generates a different report 
- Creating your own direct html reports isn't much more complicated -- just tell R to write the html that you want, and packages such as **googleVis** can make it pretty easy to include plots

## Direct PDF Reports

Since R can write PDF files itself, you can product PDF reports without using a markup language.

```{r echo = FALSE}
iris_cairo <- function(ll, out_dir) {
  Cairo::CairoPDF(file = file.path(out_dir, 
                            paste0(names(ll), ".pdf")),
           width = 8.5,
           height = 11)
  layout(mat = matrix(
    c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0,
      0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
    ncol = 3,
    byrow = TRUE),
    widths = c(1, 6.5, 1),
    heights = c(1, 1, 4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
  opar <- par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
  on.exit(par(opar))
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, paste("Species:", names(ll)), cex = 4)
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, "Page 1 of 1", cex = 1.5)
  par(opar)
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Petal.Length, Petal.Width))
  dev.off()
  invisible(NULL)
}
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
iris_cairo <- function(ll, out_dir) {
  Cairo::CairoPDF(file = file.path(out_dir, 
                            paste0(names(ll), ".pdf")),
           width = 8.5,
           height = 11)
  layout(mat = matrix(
    c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0,
      0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
    ncol = 3,
    byrow = TRUE),
    widths = c(1, 6.5, 1),
    heights = c(1, 1, 4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
  opar <- par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
  on.exit(par(opar))
```

## Function (Continued)
```{r eval = FALSE}
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, paste("Species:", names(ll)), cex = 4)
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, "Page 1 of 1", cex = 1.5)
  par(opar)
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Petal.Length, Petal.Width))
  dev.off()
  invisible(NULL)
}
```

## Generating the Reports

```{r}

system.time({
  for (i in seq_along(iris_split)) {
    iris_cairo(iris_split[i], "cairo_pdf")
    }
  })
list.files("cairo_pdf")
```

## Isn't that a little crazy?

-It is *more* than a little crazy, but the SRTR produces some of is public reports this way:

## Markup Reports

**LaTeX** and **Markdown** are both useful markup languages to use with R

- **LaTeX** is harder to learn, but provides excellent control to produce high-quality printable reports (generally PDFs)
- **Markdown** is much, much easier to learn, but doesn't give you as much control

The two key R packages to use are **knitr** and **rmarkdown**

## Chunks

When you write your own code, you probably include comments -- bits of text that are ignored when the program runs that are identified by a special syntax.

Writing an R + markup language report largely flips the code/comment structure.  The main body of the document is written in a markup language, but chunks of R code are included and identified with a special syntax.

## Parameterized **rmarkdown**

**rmarkdown** lets you pass parameters when you compile the reports, which makes it easy to write a loop

[See Example]

## The HTML Loop

```{r eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  for (i in names(iris_split)) {
    rmarkdown::render(
      "iris_markdown.Rmd",
      output_format = "html_document",
      output_file = paste0(i, ".html"),
      output_dir = "rmarkdown_html",
      params = list(species = i),
      quiet = TRUE)
  }
})
```

This takes about 2 seconds.

## The PDF Loop

```{r eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  for (i in names(iris_split)) {
    rmarkdown::render(
      "iris_markdown.Rmd",
      output_format = "pdf_document",
      output_file = paste0(i, ".pdf"),
      output_dir = "rmarkdown_pdf",
      params = list(species = i),
      quiet = TRUE)
  }
})
```
This takes about 6 seconds -- direct to PDF took less than 0.1 seconds!
