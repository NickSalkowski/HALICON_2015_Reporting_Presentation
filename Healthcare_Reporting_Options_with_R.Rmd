## Disclaimer

- These are my own views ... 
- not the the views of the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation ...
- and not the views of the Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

## There are so many options ...

The right approach to producing reports depends on:

- Your Data
- Your Audience
- Your Analysis
- Your Report Universe

Of course, there might not be one approach that works a lot better than the others.

## Your Data

- How big is your data set?
- How often is your data updated?
- How important are up-to-date reports?

## Your Audience

- Does your audience need a static report or an interactive report?
- Does your audience need a specific report format?

## Your Analysis

- Does your analysis need an unusually powerful computer?
- Does your analysis take a long time?

## Your Report Universe

- Do you know which reports will be needed?
- How many different reports might be needed?

## Three Basic Report Frameworks

- **Direct**

    R writes the final report itself 

- **Markup**

    R writes the report in a markup language
    
    The markup language file is processed into the final report format

- **Interactive**
    
    R does the analysis behind a user interface

## Direct Reports

- Direct reports can usually be generated quickly, which is important if you need to produce a large number of reports, or the reports will quickly become obsolete.
- Report formatting can be challenging.

## Markup Reports

- The markup language makes it much easier to format reports
- The process of generating the final report may be slow

## Interactive Reports

- Only generate the reports needed by your audience
- Reports are as current as the data used

## Example Data Set

```{r}
iris_split <- split(
  x = iris[-5], 
  f = iris$Species)
class(iris_split)
names(iris_split)
head(iris_split$setosa, 3)
```

## Direct Text Report Function

```{r}
iris_text <- function(ll, out_dir) {
  out_file <- file.path(out_dir, paste0(names(ll), 
                               ".txt"))
  write(
    x = c(paste("Species:", names(ll), "\n"),
          paste("Mean Sepal Length:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Sepal.Length"]])),
          paste("Mean Sepal Width:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Sepal.Width"]])),
          paste("Mean Petal Length:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Petal.Length"]])),
          paste("Mean Petal Width:", 
                mean(ll[[1]][["Petal.Width"]]), "\n"),
          "Page 1 of 1"),
    file = out_file,
    append = FALSE)
  invisible(NULL)
}
```

## Generating the Reports

```{r}
system.time({
  for (i in seq_along(iris_split)) {
    iris_text(iris_split[i], "direct_txt")
    }
  })
list.files("direct_txt")
```

## Example Report 

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = ""}
cat(paste(readLines(file.path("direct_txt", "setosa.txt")), collapse = "\n"))
```

## Justification

That report wasn't very impressive, but

- It illustrated the basic structure: write a loop where each iteration generates a different report 
- Creating your own direct html reports isn't much more complicated -- just tell R to write the html that you want, and packages such as **googleVis** can make it pretty easy to include plots

## Real Direct to HTML Example

The SRTR uses R to directly write HTML for some tables:

![PSR HTML Example](pres_figs/html_PSR.png)

## Direct PDF Reports

Since R can write PDF files itself, you can product PDF reports without using a markup language.

```{r echo = FALSE}
iris_cairo <- function(ll, out_dir) {
  Cairo::CairoPDF(file = file.path(out_dir, 
                            paste0(names(ll), ".pdf")),
           width = 8.5,
           height = 11)
  layout(mat = matrix(
    c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0,
      0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
    ncol = 3,
    byrow = TRUE),
    widths = c(1, 6.5, 1),
    heights = c(1, 1, 4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
  opar <- par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
  on.exit(par(opar))
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, paste("Species:", names(ll)), cex = 4)
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, "Page 1 of 1", cex = 1.5)
  par(opar)
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Petal.Length, Petal.Width))
  dev.off()
  invisible(NULL)
}
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
iris_cairo <- function(ll, out_dir) {
  Cairo::CairoPDF(file = file.path(out_dir, 
                            paste0(names(ll), ".pdf")),
           width = 8.5,
           height = 11)
  layout(mat = matrix(
    c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0,
      0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0),
    ncol = 3,
    byrow = TRUE),
    widths = c(1, 6.5, 1),
    heights = c(1, 1, 4, 4, 0.5, 0.5))
  opar <- par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
  on.exit(par(opar))
```

## Function (Continued)
```{r eval = FALSE}
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, paste("Species:", names(ll)), cex = 4)
  plot(0, 0, type = 'n', bty = 'n', ann = FALSE, 
       xaxt = 'n', yaxt = 'n')
  text(0, 0, "Page 1 of 1", cex = 1.5)
  par(opar)
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
  with(ll[[1]], plot(Petal.Length, Petal.Width))
  dev.off()
  invisible(NULL)
}
```

## Generating the Reports

```{r}

system.time({
  for (i in seq_along(iris_split)) {
    iris_cairo(iris_split[i], "cairo_pdf")
    }
  })
list.files("cairo_pdf")
```

## Isn't that a little crazy?

-It is *more* than a little crazy, but the SRTR produces some of is public reports this way:

![PSR Example](pres_figs/PSR.png)

## Markup Reports

**LaTeX** and **Markdown** are both useful markup languages to use with R

- **LaTeX** is harder to learn, but provides excellent control to produce high-quality printable reports (generally PDFs)
- **Markdown** is much, much easier to learn, but doesn't give you as much control

The two key R packages to use are **knitr** and **rmarkdown**

## Chunks

When you write your own code, you probably include comments -- bits of text that are ignored when the program runs that are identified by a special syntax.

Writing an R + markup language report largely flips the code/comment structure.  The main body of the document is written in a markup language, but chunks of R code are included and identified with a special syntax.

**rmarkdown** lets you pass parameters when you compile the reports, which makes it easy to write a loop

## Markdown Example

![Rmd Ex](pres_figs/rmd_ex.png)

## The HTML Loop

```{r eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  for (i in names(iris_split)) {
    rmarkdown::render(
      "iris_markdown.Rmd",
      output_format = "html_document",
      output_file = paste0(i, ".html"),
      output_dir = "rmarkdown_html",
      params = list(species = i),
      quiet = TRUE)
  }
})
```

This takes about 2 seconds.

## The PDF Loop

```{r eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  for (i in names(iris_split)) {
    rmarkdown::render(
      "iris_markdown.Rmd",
      output_format = "pdf_document",
      output_file = paste0(i, ".pdf"),
      output_dir = "rmarkdown_pdf",
      params = list(species = i),
      quiet = TRUE)
  }
})
```
This took over 6 seconds -- direct to PDF took about 0.1 seconds!

## The docx Loop

```{r eval = FALSE}
system.time({
  for (i in names(iris_split)) {
    rmarkdown::render(
      "iris_markdown.Rmd",
      output_format = "word_document",
      output_file = paste0(i, ".docx"),
      output_dir = "rmarkdown_docx",
      params = list(species = i),
      quiet = TRUE)
  }
})
```

This took about  2 seconds.

## Interactive Reports: **shiny**

- **shiny** is an R package that facilitates creating interactive reports
- R itself can be used to run the interactive reports
- **Shiny Server** can be used to host the reports on the web
- **shinyapps.io** is a hosting service for shiny apps

## The UI Function

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel('Iris Summary Plots'),
  sidebarPanel(
    selectInput('species', 'Species', 
                unique(as.character(iris$Species)))),
  mainPanel(
    htmlOutput("spec_title"),
    plotOutput('plot1'),
    plotOutput('plot2')
  )
))
```

## The Server Function

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyServer(function(input, output, session) {
  selectedData <- reactive({
    iris[which(iris$Species == input$species), -5]
  })
  output$spec_title <- renderPrint({
    (h2(paste("Species:", input$species)))
  })
  output$plot1 <- renderPlot({
    with(selectedData(), plot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width))
  })
  output$plot2 <- renderPlot({
    with(selectedData(), plot(Petal.Length, Petal.Width))
  })
})
```

## Data Considerations

If your data set is updated frequently, and up-to-date reports are important, then the direct and interactive approaches might work best:

- The direct approach produces reports quickly, reducing the lag between when the data is queried and the production of the report
- The interactive approach can generate reports with *current* data

## Your Audience

- The direct and markup approaches can create static reports in a variety of formats (html, PDF, docx)
- The interactive approach lets your audience decide whatever it wants

## Your Analysis

- If your analysis is computationally intensive, then the direct or markdown approaches might work better, since the reports can be generated whenever it is convenient.  Interactive reports would require your audience to wait.

## Your Report Universe

- If you know which reports will be needed, any of the approaches can work.
- If you *also* know that the number of reports is very large, then the markdown approach might be too slow.
- If you don't know which reports will be needed, and the number of possible reports is *large*, then the interactive approach might be best.
