# HALICON_2015_Reporting_Presentation

Presentation for the October 23, 2015 HALICON conference

## Healthcare Reporting Options with R 

R has multiple systems for generating reports from your data, and which system is best depends on your data and your audience. The pros and cons of several different reporting systems will be discussed as well as factors to consider when choosing which reporting system to use. Using R alone, using R with a markup language, and using the shiny package are all viable methods for generating report cards or statistical quality control reports.
